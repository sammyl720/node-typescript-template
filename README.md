# TypeScript Template Project

This is a template project for kickstarting TypeScript projects. It provides a basic setup with TypeScript, Jest for testing, and nodemon for development with automatic restarts.

## Getting Started

To use this template for your own projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Install the project dependencies by running the following command in the project root directory:

```
yarn
```

3. Run the project in development mode with automatic restarts using the following command:
```
yarn dev:start
```

This will start the project using `nodemon` and `ts-node`, enabling automatic restarts whenever changes are detected in the TypeScript files.

4. To run the tests, use the following command:
```
yarn test
```

This will execute the test files using the Jest testing framework.

5. Customize the project according to your needs by modifying the source files in the `src` directory. You can also add additional dependencies, configurations, or files as required for your specific project.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src/`: This directory contains the source code of your TypeScript project.
- `tests/`: This directory contains the test files for your project's unit tests.
- `dist/`: This directory is generated during the build process and contains the transpiled JavaScript files.
